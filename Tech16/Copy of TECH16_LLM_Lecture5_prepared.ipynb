Additionally, the concern arises from the fact that AI is an expensive solution intended to replace low-cost labor, which may not make sense initially. Another challenge highlighted is the uncertainty around rapidly scaling AI capabilities by just increasing GPU capacity, as doubling data and compute capacity may not necessarily double the capacities of AI models due to the complexity of measuring AI improvements in tasks like customer service or text summarization.\n","\u001b[0m**********\n","Trace: query\n","    |_query -> 5.529676 seconds\n","      |_llm -> 1.24403 seconds\n","      |_sub_question -> 1.288012 seconds\n","        |_query -> 1.287384 seconds\n","          |_retrieve -> 0.120102 seconds\n","            |_embedding -> 0.113079 seconds\n","          |_synthesize -> 1.166604 seconds\n","            |_templating -> 1.9e-05 seconds\n","            |_llm -> 1.162016 seconds\n","      |_sub_question -> 1.71836 seconds\n","        |_query -> 1.717288 seconds\n","          |_retrieve -> 0.196508 seconds\n","            |_embedding -> 0.190727 seconds\n","          |_synthesize -> 1.520077 seconds\n","            |_templating -> 2e-05 seconds\n","            |_llm -> 1.515266 seconds\n","      |_synthesize -> 2.562498 seconds\n","        |_templating -> 3.2e-05 seconds\n","        |_llm -> 2.556055 seconds\n","**********\n","The information provided suggests that there is a significant level of interest and investment in AI, with growing expectations about its potential benefits.

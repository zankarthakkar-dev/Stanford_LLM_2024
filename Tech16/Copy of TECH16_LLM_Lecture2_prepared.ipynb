In this section we will be exploring direct and also indirect\\nadvancements towards application of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG)\\nin legal domain giving the priority to generative AI approaches.\\nGuha et al. [ 6] introduce the LegalBench which is a collaborative benchmark for measuring legal reasoning in LLMs.\\nTheir work focuses on establishing a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs in legal reasoning. By employing\\nthe Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion framework (IRAC), which is a widely used method for organising legal analysis,\\nthe authors have initiated a collaborative project aimed at developing a comprehensive and open-source benchmark.\\nThis endeavour emphasises the potential for computational tools to enhance legal practices, especially in administrative\\nand transactional settings. However, the primary objective of LegalBench is not to replace legal professionals with\\ncomputational systems, but to assess the extent to which current models can support and augment legal reasoning.\\nOur research, in contrast, delves into a more specialised commercial domain within legal technology, focusing on\\nthe application of LLMs in determining and locating legal issues in contracts. This specific focus on contract analysis\\nsets our work apart from the broader legal reasoning perspective adopted in LegalBench. While Guha et al. emphasise\\nthe need for collaborative efforts and in developing benchmarks for legal reasoning with open source data, our study\\nprovides a detailed and practical examination of the capabilities of LLMs compared directly with legal practitioners,\\nincluding Junior Lawyers and LPOs. This aspect of direct comparison is particularly significant as it sheds light on the\\npractical effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs in real-world legal tasks, a perspective not deeply explored in LegalBench.\\nThe significance of our work is further accentuated by its emphasis on the efficiency of LLMs in contract review, a\\ncrucial aspect in legal practice where time is a critical factor. Our study not only benchmarks the performance of LLMs\\nagainst human practitioners but also evaluates their efficiency in terms of time and cost, offering valuable insights into\\nthe practical application of these models in legal settings. This focus on both performance and efficiency provides a\\npragmatic perspective that has an immediate applicability in legal tasks such as contract review, which are common\\nand often time intensive.\\nIn conclusion, while LegalBench establishes a foundational framework for evaluating LLMs in legal reasoning, our\\nresearch offers a more focused and application-oriented analysis within the legal field. By comparing the capabilities'),\n","  Document(metadata={'source': '2401.16212.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Better Call GPT, Comparing Large Language Models Against Lawyers 3\\nand efficiency of LLMs with those of human legal practitioners in the specific context of contract review, our study\\naddresses a critical gap in the current research landscape. This approach not only benchmarks the effectiveness of\\nLLMs in a practical legal task but also provides substantial contributions to the evolving field of legal technology and\\nits applications.\\nTan et al. [ 9] bring a more practical dimension to the theory oriented approach we noticed in the previous research.\\nAlthough this study does not focus on a deep statistical analysis, it provides some important aspect of practical usage of\\nexisting tools. A key aspect of this research, the comparative analysis between ChatGPT and JusticeBot, provides a\\nnuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of AI-driven legal tools. The study acknowledges that while\\nChatGPT may not always provide perfectly accurate or reliable information, it offers a powerful and intuitive interface\\nfor general public, a significant consideration in enhancing access to legal information.\\nHowever, Tan et al. also identify potential areas for improvement, particularly in the reliability and depth of the legal\\ninformation provided by ChatGPT. In the legal field, where incorrect information can have serious consequences, these\\naspects are of utmost importance. The research suggests the need for continuous improvement and testing of ChatGPT,\\nespecially in the terms of keeping the model updated with the latest legal development and training it on diverse legal\\nscenarios. Although, Open AI claims that ChatGPT currently performs in the level of a legal graduate, there is no\\nevidence in its performance in various legal scenarios. This is one of the key aspect which we tried to address in our\\nresearch.\\nCallister [ 3] delves into the philosophical and cognitive implications of AI in law, addressing concerns about the\\nreliability and consistency of AI, and highlighting potential issues such as information hallucination. It also emphasises\\nthe transformative nature of AI in shifting the traditional paradigms of legal research.\\nWhile Callister [ 3] focus on the philosophical aspect of AI and LLM’s ability to involve in the legal decision making,\\nwe tried to offer a viewpoint of practical capabilities and efficiency of LLM’s in specific legal tasks. We, however, agree\\nwith the cautionary perspective on the broader implications of generative AI for legal epistemology brought to light by\\nCallister [3] which needs to be accounted when using generative AI widely in legal decision making.\\nChoi et al. [ 4] bring a new dimension to the LLMs applicability in legal domain by focusing on ChatGPT’s applicability\\nin legal education. Although this research does not directly align with our study’s interest in AI’s application in the\\nlegal domain, it brings some new perspectives on how LLMs perform in the legal domain. One of the key findings in\\nthis study is the analysis of limited ability of ChaptGPT to perform complex legal analysis and issue spotting which we\\nmainly focused on our research. Our research also extends this dialogue by comparing LLMs’ performance not just\\nto academic standards (as noticed in [ 6]), but also against real world legal practitioners, particularly Junior Lawyers\\nand LPO professionals. This comparison offers a novel perspective on the utility of LLMs in practical legal work, a\\ndimension not fully explored in any of the aforementioned research attempts.\\n3 METHODOLOGY\\nThis section focuses on the research methodology covering how data was collected, analysed, prepared, and how the\\nmodels were selected to be included as part of this research.\\n3.1 Overall Design\\nThe experiment was designed to compare Junior Lawyers and LPOs against LLMs using Senior Lawyers as a benchmark,\\nestablishing ground truth for determining and locating legal issues in contracts.
